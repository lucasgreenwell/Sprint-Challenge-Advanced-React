*  Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

	Pretending hooks don’t exist, you need to use a class component to initialize any state in your app. 

*  Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

	Constructor which initializes state and extends any parent classes. componentDidMount, which is the best place to run any asynchronous code. And the render method which actually mounts the component to the DOM. 

*  What is the purpose of a custom hook?

	To have a function that uses some utility in a reusable way. 

*  Why is it important to test our apps?

	Helps consider edge cases, helps write better code, keeps our code maintainable.
